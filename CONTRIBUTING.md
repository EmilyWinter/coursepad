# Contributing to CoursePad.me
Thank you for your interest in contributing! While we appreciate your enthusiasm, please read this document in its entirety before writing any code or sending a pull request.

## How to contribute
CoursePad.me is hosted on GitHub, and feel free to fork our repository and send us a pull request. However there are a couple of idiosyncrasies that you probably need to be aware of.

First, we squash commits before they are merged. This is to ensure our version history is tidy and readable, instead of being littered by thousands of "fix typo" commits.

Second, we maintain a linear version history, i.e. we never create a merge commit. This is because we want to ensure our version history is easy to reason about.

Therefore, before a pull request can be merged, please make sure that it only consists of one commit, and its parent is the tip of `master`.

## New Feature
CoursePad.me is intended to provide a lean experience of course scheduling. Therefore, before you work on any big new feature, please open an issue and have a discussion with the community. Feature bloat is so common in software industry, and we want to avoid that.

## Code of Conduct
