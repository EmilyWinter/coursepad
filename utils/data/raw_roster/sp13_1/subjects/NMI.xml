Students can drop after the FIRST CLASS ONLY - by sending an email to the Johnson School Registrar's Office at gm-registrar@cornell.edu.  There is a late fee of $100.00 for each add or drop transaction after the 1st class meeting.    You will receive a &quot;W&quot; on your transcript in addition to the late fees after the 1st class meeting. &#13;
Non-Johnson students may add themselves to the waitlists during the enrollment periods, however Johnson Students have priority into the classes and non-Johnsons will be enrolled: 1) IF seats are still available after Johnson students complete their enrollment period and 2) IF the instructor allows.</note></notes></section></sections></course><course subject="NMI" catalog_nbr="5061"><course_title>CFA Review Level I</course_title><units>2</units><grading_basis_sdescr>SX/UX(SUX)</grading_basis_sdescr><class_descr>CFA Review Level I</class_descr><topics/><crosslists/><comeetings/><sections><section class_number="12555" subject="NMI" catalog_nbr="5061" ssr_component="IND" class_section="001"><consent_ldescr>Department Consent Required</consent_ldescr><associated_class>1</associated_class><subcourse_indicator>N</subcourse_indicator><meeting><meeting_pattern_sdescr>W</meeting_pattern_sdescr><building_code>SGH</building_code><room>B06</room><facility_ldescr>Sage Graduate Hall B06</facility_ldescr><start_time>06:00PM</start_time><end_time>09:00PM</end_time><start_date>01/21/2013</start_date><end_date>05/04/2013</end_date><instructors><instructor>Bhojraj,S (sb235)</instructor></instructors></meeting><notes><note>Enrollment by Permission Only&#13;
